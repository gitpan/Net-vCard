NAME
    Net::vCard - Read and write vCard files (RFC 2426). vCard files hold
    personal information that you would typically find on a business card.
    Name, numbers, addresses, and even logos. This module can also serve as
    a base class for other vFile readers.

SYNOPSIS
      use Net::vCard;

      my $cards=Net::vCard->loadFile( "addresses.vcf" );

      foreach my $card ( @$cards ) {
        print $card->{'N'}{'firstName'}, " ", $card->{'N'}{'lastName'}, "\n";
      }

MODULE STATUS
    The current state of this module is a pretty solid parser and internal
    data structure.

    Now I will be adding get/set handlers for the various properties. As
    well, I'd really like to get some pathelogical data from different vCard
    producers. Right now I have a pretty good handle on Apple's Addressbook
    - which is the whole reason why I wrote this stuff.

    For those who really want to use this module right away

      - go ahead and access the hash values directly for the time being
      - keep in mind that I will be making a get/set method interface
      - once that is established you will need to use that interface instead

SUPPORT
    For technical support please email to jlawrenc@cpan.org ... for faster
    service please include "Net::vCard" and "help" in your subject line.
